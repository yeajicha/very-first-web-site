    Kiss me on my neck<br>
Tell me all your fears<br>
'Cause the rush of love is gone<br>
And I'm tryna find out why it disappeared<br>
Why it disappeared<br>
I look you in the eyes<br>
Don't feel nothing here<br>
'Cause the feeling of the love that I used to have<br>
Yeah, that shit's disappeared<br>
Yeah, that shit's disappeared<br>
Yeah, that shit's disappeared<br>
Yeah, that shit's disappeared<br>
Yeah, that shit's disappeared<br>
Do you remember<br>
Our love in November?<br>
That shit was so real<br>
But there's patches on my fingers that won't heal<br>
There's patches on my fingers that won't feel<br>
Why'd you have to fuckin' disappear?<br>
Why'd you have to fuckin' disappear?<br>
Why'd you disappear?<br>
Why'd you disappear?<br>
Why'd you disappear?<br>
Please come back<br>
Please come back<br>
Please come back<br>
Please come back<br></p>
